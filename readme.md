### End User Instructions ###

Install and run! I use this everyday and have really enjoyed using this for interval workouts out the track. If I'm doing 400 repeats, I can set the alerts to vibrate at my planned 100m pace, so I can know whether I'm on pace or not. I also use it for all my easy runs just because the Chrono Timers are easy to read and the splits work well.
